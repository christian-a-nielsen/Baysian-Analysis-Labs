## ðŸ“– About
The labs in this repository are drawn from coursework that follows the structure of Reich & Ghoshâ€™s text. They provide hands-on practice with key Bayesian methods and concepts, including:

- Bayesian inference for simple models  
- Conjugate priors and posterior derivations  

These materials reflect my learning process and solutions, and are implemented in **R**.
